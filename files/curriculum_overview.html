      <h2>
        Washington University Nursery School uses a child-centered, play-based curriculum that supports the social,
        emotional, intellectual, and physical development of each child. The sections below highlight the core
        components of our curriculum, designed to foster a love of learning and promote the growth of the whole child.

        <p>
          At Washington University Nursery School, we believe children are unique individuals with their own patterns and
          timetables for development. We support and encourage growth through a child-centered, process-oriented,
          play-based curriculum.
