        <p>
          At Washington University Nursery School, we believe children are unique individuals with their own patterns and
          timetables for development. We support and encourage growth through a child-centered, process-oriented,
          play-based curriculum.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Teachers build learning experiences by:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structuring experiences around ideas relevant to children, with learning happening through discussion, experimentation, and meaningful materials</li>
          <li>Offering hands-on activities that engage multiple senses and encourage exploration</li>
          <li>Letting children interact at their own pace (individually, with partners, or in groups)</li>
          <li>Asking open-ended questions and giving children time to think, respond, and reason</li>
          <li>Respecting children’s ideas and building independence and problem-solving skills</li>
