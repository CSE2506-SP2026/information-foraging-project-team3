      <p>For more information on policies and procedures, check out the complete <a class="download" href="downloads/parent_handbook.pdf">WUNS Parent Handbook</a>.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Orientation Day</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p> This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect during the school year. </p>

        <p> The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Parent-Staff Communication</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p> Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p> Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for children. </p>

        <p> The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Discipline</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p> The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe. </p>
        
        <p> Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior.</p>

        <p> When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with parents at which it may be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community services if parents so desire. </p>
